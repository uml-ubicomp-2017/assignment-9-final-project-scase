Correcting Visual errors using Smart Glasses
Samartha K V	Monisha Raja


One of the oldest problems facing humans is that of poor eyesight. Methods to correct this problem include usage of spectacles and laser surgery. These are the prevalent methods from around 1990s, first patented by Juergen, who describes their usage to improve visual acuity [1]. Even refractive surgery is common nowadays [2]. Pursuing down the line of using lenses to correct refractive errors in eyesight, we propose a new type of smart wear, that could make regular spectacles obsolete.
